"

A minimum pressure of at least 276 kP a (40 psi) must be provided at all nodes at average day flow as
well as instantaneous peak flow, which is 1.8 times the average day flow. 

The system is also subject to fire flows under which it must supply water at a minimum pressure of at
least 138 kP a (20 psi). Details of different loading conditions and the variation in water use throughout the day are from Walters et al. (1999).
